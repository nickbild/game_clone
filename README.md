# Neural Pong

*More details coming soon...*

I have cloned Pong with a neural network. The neural network is not playing Pong, it ***is*** Pong, and you play it.

After designing a model architecture that is well-suited to learning the physics of the game, I was able to teach it all of the game rules and how to interpret user inputs by showing it hundreds of thousands of sequential frames captured during normal gameplay.

## How It Works

I wrote a simple [Pong game](https://github.com/nickbild/game_clone/blob/main/pong.py) using pygame. As each frame is displayed, it writes a text file containing information on the positions of the paddles, the position of the ball, and the state of the user inputs. This data, along with suppplemental synthetic data that simulates a paddle miss (which is otherwise a rare event) that is generated by [this script](https://github.com/nickbild/game_clone/blob/main/gen_misses.py), is used to train an artificial neural network. The architecture is represented in the diagram below:
