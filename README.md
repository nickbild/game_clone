# Neural Pong

*More details coming soon...*

I have cloned Pong with a neural network. The neural network is not playing Pong, it ***is*** Pong, and you play it.

After designing a model architecture that is well-suited to learning the physics of the game, I was able to teach it all of the game rules and how to interpret user inputs by showing it hundreds of thousands of sequential frames captured during normal gameplay.
