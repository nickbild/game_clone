# Neural Pong

*More details coming soon...*

I have cloned Pong with a neural network. The neural network is not playing Pong, it ***is*** Pong, and you play it.

After designing a model architecture that is well-suited to learning the physics of the game, I was able to teach it all of the game rules and how to interpret user inputs by showing it hundreds of thousands of sequential frames captured during normal gameplay.

## How It Works

I wrote a simple [Pong-style game](https://github.com/nickbild/game_clone/blob/main/pong.py) using pygame. As each frame is displayed, it writes a text file containing information on the positions of the paddles, the position of the ball, and the state of the user inputs. This data, along with suppplemental synthetic data that simulates a paddle miss (which is otherwise a rare event) that is generated by [this script](https://github.com/nickbild/game_clone/blob/main/gen_misses.py), is used to train an artificial neural network. The architecture is represented in the diagram below:

Whoah! All that to learn Pong? It may seem like overkill, but the physics are actually difficult to learn. I started out thinking I'd have this running in a few hours with a simple feedforward network, but it ended up taking months of spare time to get it working. The velocity inversion of the ball at bounces, the paddle hits and misses, and the issue of paddle movement and ball movement inappropriately being linked together, for instance, was very, very hard for any model I tried to learn. Aside from basic feedforward architectures, I also tried LSTM/GRU layers, convolutional layers, and (as it felt, anyway) just about everything else.

What ended up finally working was a Transformer-based architecture with multiple isolated branches and output heads. Next I'll go into a deep-dive of the model.
